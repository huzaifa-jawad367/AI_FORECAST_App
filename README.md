# AI FORECASRT App

This is an iPhone app for the AI-FORECAST project for capturing the above ground biomass of trees using the iPhone camera and the ARkit framework. The app is intended to help foresters conduct on-ground surveys regarding biomass of 
forest trees in a study region.

The app utilises ARkit and the iPhone camera to capture various measurements of trees like the height of the tree, the diameter at breast height and the species of the tree. These measurements and specifications of the trees are then used 
as inputs in Allometric equations to calculate the biomass of the tree.

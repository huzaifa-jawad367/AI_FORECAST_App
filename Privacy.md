# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: June 2025_

Welcome to **AI_FORECAST_App** (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our app for AR-based height measurement and biomass estimation.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Data You Provide
- **Camera and Sensor Data**: To perform height measurements, the App uses your device’s camera and motion sensors. No images or raw sensor data are stored or transmitted off your device.  
- **Optional Feedback**: If you choose to send feedback or crash reports, you may provide text descriptions or allow the App to include basic device diagnostics (e.g., device model, OS version).

### 1.2 Automatically Collected Data
- **Usage Analytics**: We may collect anonymized usage statistics (such as feature usage counts and session duration) to improve the App’s performance. This data does not identify you personally.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- **Core Functionality**: Camera and sensor input is used in real-time on-device to calculate measurements; no measurement data leaves your device unless you explicitly export or share results.  
- **App Improvement**: Anonymized analytics help us understand usage patterns and fix bugs.  
- **Support**: Feedback data is used to troubleshoot issues and improve user experience.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **Third Parties**: We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties.  
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.

## 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect data processed by the App. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us to request deletion.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by updating the “Last updated” date.
